# CLPort

Really not a fantastic site by any means. Lots of stuff needs to get done, but I needed to put something out there.

Will 100% redo this with react and ethers.js and will probably incorporate blockchain somehow, still brainstorming.
- Probably something along the lines of deploying my resume on a testnet and using read functions? That way a user
    shouldn't need an injected wallet or anything like that. We'll see.
